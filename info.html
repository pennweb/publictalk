      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="333366"><a name="whatis"></a>What 
        exactly is &quot;Public Talk?&quot;</font></b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Public talk&quot; is 
        public conversation among citizens that helps a neighborhood, an organization, 
        a community -- or even total strangers -- deal with issues that are important 
        to them and their lives. More than simply &quot;talk for talk's sake,&quot; 
        it is productive dialogue that lets people take ownership of the conversation, 
        understand one another, and move forward together toward concrete outcomes. 
        Public talk takes place in settings where experts, community leaders, 
        and citizens from all walks of life can come together in an honest, forthright 
        manner, and it encourages every participant to contribute to the conversation, 
        without privileging anyone's ideas or opinions. Most of all, public talk 
        is about the members of a community rolling up their sleeves and doing 
        real work together, despite meaningful differences. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When public talk is taking 
        place, it creates a rich, vibrant dialogue that engages the civic imagination 
        of participants, spurs citizens to collective action, and deepens our 
        appreciation of the complex challenges and creative opportunities for 
        living together in contemporary communities. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="000066"><b><font color="333366"><a name="building"></a>Building 
        a National Movement</font> </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Penn Public Talk Project 
        is working to strengthen an emerging national movement in support of effective 
        public discourse and the growth of strong, inclusive communities across 
        the country and around the world. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we enter the 21st century, 
        technology, urbanization, mobility, mass communications, and other social 
        forces have created a rapidly evolving civic landscape in which it is 
        easy for citizens and leaders alike to feel frustrated, isolated, and 
        ultimately, alienated from public life. Public talk can play a central 
        role in creating &quot;communities of conversation&quot; that help alleviate 
        these feelings, building a sense of connection and shared public purpose. 
        Although effective programs, formats and techniques exist to facilitate 
        this process of community-building, even experts in the field can find 
        their efforts too isolated and fragmented to have significant impact. 
        The absence of widespread, national public exposure for successful discourse 
        efforts can make it difficult for new participants to know where to begin. 
        Locally and nationally, leaders are often unaware of ways in which they 
        might better facilitate constructive public talk in their communities. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Through local, regional, and 
        national public discourse events, professional conferences, publications, 
        Internet resources, and other activities, the Penn Public Talk Project 
        provides a much-needed resource for citizens, discourse practitioners, 
        community leaders, academic specialists, cultural institutions, and civic 
        organizations. It aims to raise public and institutional awareness about 
        issues of public engagement, illustrate the wealth of valuable tools, 
        techniques, and opportunities available to develop thriving civic exchanges, 
        and change public expectations of civic life. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Project also works to 
        bring together discourse practitioners, from novices to experts, through 
        both live events and interactive cybercommunities. Aided by emerging technologies, 
        the Project works to make key building blocks of successful discourse 
        programs -- contact resources, factual information, research tools, expert 
        consultation -- readily accessible and continuously available to all.</font></p>

        &quot;Public Talk&quot;</font></b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Penn Public Talk Project's 
        programmatic initiatives are designed to achieve three critical tasks 
        identified by the Penn National Commission: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The creation of a nationwide 
          network of venues that are available and committed to the conduct of 
          productive public talk and the development of robust &quot;communities 
          of conversation.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The development of civic 
          leaders who are committed and properly prepared to lead these conversations. 
          <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The demonstration of exemplary 
          discourse practices through a variety of public programs that address 
          societal issues on which there is substantial disagreement. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Through both its own public 
        programs and partnerships with a wide variety of other organizations and 
        institutions --discourse programs, libraries, museums, colleges and universities, 
        community organizations, schools, issue advocacy groups, human relations 
        organizations, and professional and affinity-based associations -- the 
        Penn Public Talk Project is supporting a variety of creative efforts to 
        foster a sense of shared community and civic engagement in the rapidly 
        changing social and cultural environment of the early 21st century. </font></p>

        of the Penn Public Talk Project </font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Penn Public Talk Project 
        has its roots in the work of the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pnc/">Penn 
        National Commission on Society, Culture and Community</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beginning in 1996, the Commission's 
        chair and convenor, University of Pennsylvania President <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/president/rodin/">Dr. 
        Judith Rodin</a>, challenged an international group of 48 leading scholars, 
        political figures, and shapers of public opinion to address the &quot;polarization, 
        oversimplification, and isolation from important cultural and intellectual 
        traditions&quot; that appeared to characterize our public discourse. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over a three-year period, 
        the Commission carefully examined the problems of contemporary public 
        discussion and behavior through a series of activities, including coast-to-coast 
        plenary meetings, papers, and commissioned research. The Commission also 
        studied how to foster more engaged and thoughtful conversations about 
        contemporary social issues. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Guided by these findings, 
        the Penn Public Talk Project now seeks to implement the Commission's findings 
        through its innovative, collaborative programs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Penn's 
        Commitment:</i></font><i> </i></b>The Penn Public Talk Project is a natural 
        extension of the University of Pennsylvania's educational philosophy, 
        dating to the principles of its founder, Benjamin Franklin, who linked 
        the theoretical with the practical and viewed &quot;service to humanity&quot; 
        as the ultimate &quot;aim and end&quot; of all education. In this spirit, 
        the Project's work expresses Penn's fundamental commitment to academic 
        excellence, technological innovation in research and communications, and 
        the importance of bringing academic and professional resources to bear 
        on urgent social problems. </font></p>
